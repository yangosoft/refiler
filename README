refiler is completely based on rptyr from Nelson Elhage <nelhage@nelhage.com>.

refiler uses ptrace to open a new file descriptor on a process.

Supose you started a process redirecting stdout to /dev/null but now you want 
to read stdout. With refiler you can open a new file descriptor on this 
process then call to dup2 and finally you obtain stdout (or whatever fd) 
redirected. You can change a file descriptor "on the fly" without stopping
that process.

$./refiler PID file-descriptor-to-redirect new-file 

Example: ./refiler 10250 1 /tmp/stdout-from-10250

You can achieve the same with this script and gdb: http://users.linpro.no/ingvar/fdswap.sh.txt
