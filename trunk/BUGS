- Attaching to rtorrent doesn't work right (rtorrent stops accepting input)
  (The problem is that rtorrent is using epoll to poll stdin, and we don't
   update the internal reference that the epoll fd has to the old tty).

- Attaching to a process with children doesn't work right.
  This should be possible to fix -- I just need to ptrace each child
  individually and do the same games to it.

- After attaching to a curses application, the arrow keys may not work
  right. This is because of terminal state that is configured by
  sending control characters to the terminal emulator, instead of
  through termios, and so I can't easily restore. Suspending and
  resuming the app will often usually perform the appropriate reset.
